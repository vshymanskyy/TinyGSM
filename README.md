### Arduino Client interface support
This library is easy to integrate with lots of sketches which use Ethernet or WiFi.
**PubSubClient ([MQTT](http://mqtt.org/))**, **[Blynk](http://blynk.cc)**, **HTTP Client** and **File Download** examples are provided.

![examples](/extras/examples.png)

### TinyGSM is tiny
The complete WebClient example for Arduino Uno (via Software Serial) takes little resources:
```
Sketch uses 15022 bytes (46%) of program storage space. Maximum is 32256 bytes.
Global variables use 574 bytes (28%) of dynamic memory, leaving 1474 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2048 bytes.
```
Arduino GSM library uses 15868 bytes (49%) of Flash and 1113 bytes (54%) of RAM in a similar scenario.
TinyGSM also pulls data gently from the modem (whenever possible), so it can operate on very little RAM.
**Now, you have more space for your experiments.**

## Getting Started

#### First Steps

  1. Using your phone:
    - Disable PIN code on the SIM card
    - Check your balance
    - Check that APN, User, Pass are correct and you have internet
  2. Ensure the SIM card is correctly inserted into the module
  3. Ensure that GSM antenna is firmly attached
  4. Ensure that you have a stable power supply to the module of at least **2A**.
  5. Check if serial connection is working (Hardware Serial is recommended)
     Send an ```AT``` command using [this sketch](tools/AT_Debug/AT_Debug.ino)
  6. Try out the [WebClient](https://github.com/vshymanskyy/TinyGSM/blob/master/examples/WebClient/WebClient.ino) example

#### Writing your own code

The general flow of your code should be:
- Define the module that you are using (choose one and only one)
    - ie, ```#define TINY_GSM_MODEM_SIM800```
- Included TinyGSM
    - ```#include <TinyGsmClient.h>```
- Create a TinyGSM modem instance
    - ```TinyGsm modem(SerialAT);```
- Create one or more TinyGSM client instances
    - For a single connection, use
        - ```TinyGsmClient client(modem);```
        or
        ```TinyGsmClientSecure client(modem);``` (on supported modules)
    - For multiple connections (on supported modules) use:
        - ```TinyGsmClient clientX(modem, 0);```, ```TinyGsmClient clientY(modem, 1);```, etc
          or
        - ```TinyGsmClientSecure clientX(modem, 0);```, ```TinyGsmClientSecure clientY(modem, 1);```, etc
    - Secure and insecure clients can usually be mixed when using multiple connections.
    - The total number of connections possible varies by module
- Begin your serial communication and set all your pins as required to power your module and bring it to full functionality.
    - The examples attempt to guess the module's baud rate.  In working code, you should use a set baud.
- Wait for the module to be ready (could be as much as 6s, depending on the module)
- Initialize the modem
    - ```modem.init()``` or ```modem.restart()```
    - restart generally takes longer than init but ensures the module doesn't have lingering connections
- Unlock your SIM, if necessary:
    - ```modem.simUnlock(GSM_PIN)```
- If using **WiFi**, specify your SSID information:
    - ```modem.networkConnect(wifiSSID, wifiPass)```
    - Network registration should be automatic on cellular modules
- Wait for network registration to be successful
    - ```modem.waitForNetwork(600000L)```
- If using cellular, establish the GPRS or EPS data connection _after_ your are successfully registered on the network
    - ```modem.gprsConnect(apn, gprsUser, gprsPass)``` (or simply ```modem.gprsConnect(apn)```)
    - The same command is used for both GPRS or EPS connection
    - If using a **Digi** brand cellular XBee, you must specify your GPRS/EPS connection information _before_ waiting for the network.  This is true ONLY for _Digi cellular XBees_!  _For all other cellular modules, use the GPRS connect function after network registration._
- Connect the TCP or SSL client
    ```client.connect(server, port)```
- Send out your data.



#### If you have any issues:

  1. Read the whole README (you're looking at it!), particularly the troubleshooting section below.
  2. Some boards require [**special configuration**](https://github.com/vshymanskyy/TinyGSM/wiki/Board-configuration).
  3. Try running the Diagnostics sketch
  4. Check for [**highlighted topics here**](https://github.com/vshymanskyy/TinyGSM/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22for+reference%22+)
  5. If you have a question, please post it in our [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/tinygsm)

## How does it work?

Many GSM modems, WiFi and radio modules can be controlled by sending AT commands over Serial.
TinyGSM knows which commands to send, and how to handle AT responses, and wraps that into standard Arduino Client interface.

## API Reference

For GPRS data streams, this library provides the standard [Arduino Client](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/ClientConstructor) interface.
For additional functions, please refer to [this example sketch](examples/AllFunctions/AllFunctions.ino)

## Troubleshooting

### Ensure stable data & power connection

Most modules require _**as much as 2A**_ to properly connect to the network.
This is 4x what a "standard" USB will supply!
Improving the power supply actually solves stability problems in **many** cases!
- Read about [**powering your module**](https://github.com/vshymanskyy/TinyGSM/wiki/Powering-GSM-module).
- Keep your wires as short as possible
- Consider soldering them for a stable connection
- Do not put your wires next to noisy signal sources (buck converters, antennas, oscillators etc.)
- If everything else seems to be working but you are unable to connect to the network, check your power supply!

### Broken initial configuration

Sometimes (especially if you played with AT commands), your module configuration may become invalid.
This may result in problems such as:

 * Can't connect to the GPRS network
 * Can't connect to the server
 * Sent/received data contains invalid bytes
 * etc.

To return module to **Factory Defaults**, use this sketch:
  File -> Examples -> TinyGSM -> tools -> [FactoryReset](https://github.com/vshymanskyy/TinyGSM/blob/master/tools/FactoryReset/FactoryReset.ino)

In some cases, you may need to set an initial APN to connect to the cellular network.
Try using the ```gprsConnect(APN)``` function to set an initial APN if you are unable to register on the network.
You may need set the APN again after registering.
(In most cases, you should set the APN after registration.)

### Diagnostics sketch

Use this sketch to help diagnose SIM card and GPRS connection issues:
  File -> Examples -> TinyGSM -> tools -> [Diagnostics](https://github.com/vshymanskyy/TinyGSM/blob/master/tools/Diagnostics/Diagnostics.ino)

If the diagnostics fail, uncomment this line to output some debugging comments from the library:
```cpp
#define TINY_GSM_DEBUG SerialMon
```
In any custom code, ```TINY_GSM_DEBUG``` must be defined before including the TinyGSM library.

If you are unable to see any obvious errors in the library debugging, use [StreamDebugger](https://github.com/vshymanskyy/StreamDebugger) to copy the entire AT command sequence to the main serial port.
In the diagnostics example, simply uncomment the line:
```cpp
#define DUMP_AT_COMMANDS
```
In custom code, you can add this snippit:
```cpp
#ifdef DUMP_AT_COMMANDS
  #include <StreamDebugger.h>
  StreamDebugger debugger(SerialAT, SerialMon);
  TinyGsm modem(debugger);
#else
  TinyGsm modem(SerialAT);
#endif
```

### Web request formatting problems - "but it works with PostMan"

This library opens a TCP (or SSL) connection to a server.
In the [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model), that's [layer 4](http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_TransportLayerLayer4.htm) (or 5 for SSL).
HTTP (GET/POST), MQTT, and most of the other functions you probably want to use live up at [layer 7](http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_ApplicationLayerLayer7.htm).
This means that you need to either manually code the top layer or use another library (like [HTTPClient](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoHttpClient) or [PubSubClient](https://pubsubclient.knolleary.net/)) to do it for you.
Tools like [PostMan](https://www.postman.com/) also show layer 7, not layer 4/5 like TinyGSM.
If you are successfully connecting to a server, but getting responses of "bad request" (or no response), the issue is probably your formatting.
Here are some tips for writing layer 7 (particularly HTTP request) manually:
- Look at the "WebClient" example
- Make sure you are including all required headers.
    - If you are testing with PostMan, make sure you un-hide and look at the "auto-generated" headers; you'll probably be surprised by how many of them there are.
- Use ```client.print("...")```, or ```client.write(buf, #)```, or even ```client.write(String("..."))```, not ```client.write("...")``` to help prevent text being sent out one character at a time (typewriter style)
- Enclose the entirety of each header or line within a single string or print statement
    - use
    ```cpp
    client.print(String("GET ") + resource + " HTTP/1.1\r\n");
    ```
    instead of
    ```cpp
    client.print("GET ");
    client.print(resource);
    client.println(" HTTP/1.1")
    ```
- Make sure there is one entirely blank line between the last header and the content of any POST request.
    - Add two lines to the last header ```client.print("....\r\n\r\n")``` or put in an extra ```client.println()```
    - This is an HTTP requirement and is really easy to miss.

### SoftwareSerial problems

When using ```SoftwareSerial``` (on Uno, Nano, etc), the speed **115200** may not work.
Try selecting **57600**, **38400**, or even lower - the one that works best for you.
In some cases **9600** is unstable, but using **38400** helps, etc.
Be sure to set correct TX/RX pins in the sketch. Please note that not every Arduino pin can serve as TX or RX pin.
**Read more about SoftSerial options and configuration [here](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_AltSoftSerial.html) and [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/SoftwareSerial).**

### ESP32 Notes

#### HardwareSerial

When using ESP32 `HardwareSerial`, you may need to specify additional parameters to the `.begin()` call.
Please [refer to this comment](https://github.com/vshymanskyy/TinyGSM/issues/91#issuecomment-356024747).

#### HttpClient
You will not be able to compile the HttpClient or HttpsClient examples with ESP32 core 1.0.2.  Upgrade to 1.0.3, downgrade to version 1.0.1 or use the WebClient example.

### SAMD21

When using SAMD21-based boards, you may need to use a sercom uart port instead of `Serial1`.
Please [refer to this comment](https://github.com/vshymanskyy/TinyGSM/issues/102#issuecomment-345548941).

### Goouuu Tech IOT-GA6 vs AI-Thinker A6 confusion

It turns out that **Goouuu Tech IOT-GA6** is not the same as **AI-Thinker A6**. Unfortunately IOT-GA6 is not supported out of the box yet. There are some hints that IOT-GA6 firmware may be updated to match A6... See [this topic](https://github.com/vshymanskyy/TinyGSM/issues/164).
